        "definition": "The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term and long-term obligations. The current ratio is mainly used to give an idea of the company's ability to pay back its liabilities (debt and accounts payable) with its assets (cash, marketable securities, inventory, accounts receivable). As such, current ratio can be used to take a rough measurement of a companys financial health. The higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations, as it has a larger proportion of asset value relative to the value of its liabilities.",

It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency and activity to predict whether a company has a high degree of probability of being insolvent. A score below 1.8 means the company is probably headed for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they should buy or sell a particular stock if they're concerned about the underlying company's financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling or shorting a stock if the value is closer to 1.8.",
