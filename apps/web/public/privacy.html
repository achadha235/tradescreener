                browser preferences, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies. Cookies
                are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use your
                mobile device. Cookies are widely used by website and application owners to make the website and
                application(s) work more efficiently and to provide reporting information. As provided above, we collect

            posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other
            users of the Platform with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do
            not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We reserve the right,

            their content to your preferences. If you are visiting such sites, your web browser may allow you to set the
            DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be
            tracked. If you wish to remove your account and/or User Contribution, please contact us pursuant to this

    <p class="c7"><span class="c3">The Company is a worldwide service. By using the Platform, you authorize us to
            transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the
            purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your
            information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We take additional measures when
            information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard clauses
            approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA.
            We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data
            transfers to countries outside the EEA.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3">Yellowbrick takes safeguarding your personal information seriously. We have
            implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
            access. For example, access by a user to their personal information is available through a password and
            unique username selected by the user. This information is encrypted through the Platform with Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is
            stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Further the Databases will be
            encrypted and backed up regularly. Also, we perform regular malware scanning of the Platform and all servers
            and computers used by us to support the Platform. All Company employees are required to adhere to our
            security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user
            personal information.</span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c3">The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have
            chosen a password for access to certain parts of the Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password
            confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information
            in public areas of the Platform.</span></p>

    <p class="c7"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
            secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
            your personal information transmitted to the Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your
            own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on
            the Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, Yellowbrick will make any legally-required disclosures related
            to a breach of the security of your unencrypted electronically stored personal information to users via
            email or by conspicuously posting such on the Platform. </span></p>

            collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the
            personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate
            interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. &nbsp;We have a
            legitimate interest in operating our Platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide these

            person. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a
            contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
            personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your
